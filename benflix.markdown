Welcome to the official Benflix documentation! This page will guide you through accessing Benflix for the first time.

## Plex
Benflix runs on Plex, which allows users to stream their personal media libraryâ„¢ from anywhere. It also allows friends to access eachothers' libraries (i.e. allows me to share my library with you).

How might such a wonderful thing be acheived, you may ask? Wonder no longer!

1. Head over to [plex.tv](https://www.plex.tv/) and create a free account.
2. Open [my profile](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/user/9dc9e010ff731d50) and click *Add Friend*.
3. Let me know so I can accept your request and share my library with you.
4. Accept my sharing invitation [here](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/manage-library-access) or by clicking the link in the email.

### Where are the goods?
Once I have shared my library with you, Benflix will appear under *More >* in the menu on the left-hand side (you might have to refresh the page for it to appear the first time).

You can pin *Movies* and *TV Shows* to the menu to make your life easier.

## Overseerr
If there is nothing in my vast cornucopia of media that is to your taste, fret not - you can request movies and shows.

1. Head over to [benflix.watch](https://benflix.watch/) and log in with your Plex account. If you get "Access denied" or a similar error when logging in, wait 30 minutes and try again.
2. Search and request anything your heart desires.

### Plex Watchlist Integration
You can connect your Plex Watchlist to Overseer, so when you add something to your Watchlist it is automatically requested on Overseer.

To enable this feature, go to [Settings](https://benflix.watch/profile/settings), check *Auto-Request Movies/Series*, and click *Save Changes*.
