Welcome to the official Benflix documentation! This page will guide you through accessing Benflix for the first time.

## Plex
Benflix runs on Plex, which allows users to stream their personal media library™ from anywhere. It also allows friends to access eachothers' libraries (i.e. allows me to share my library with you).

How might such a wonderful thing be acheived, you may ask? Wonder no longer!

1. Head over to [plex.tv](https://www.plex.tv/) and create a free account.
2. Open [my profile](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/user/9dc9e010ff731d50) and click *Add Friend*.
3. Let me know so I can accept your request and share my library with you.
4. Accept my sharing invitation [here](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/manage-library-access) or by clicking the link in the email.

### Quality settings
**⚠️ You must do this on *every* device you sign in on (laptop, TV, phone). If you forget, the server will slow down and no one will be able to use Benflix!**

Go to *Settings > Quality* and set *Remote Streaming Quality* to **Maximum**.

It seems counter-intuitive, but the media I have is optimized for streaming already, so asking for anything other than maximum is less efficient.

### Where are the goods?
Once I have shared my library with you, Benflix will appear under *More >* in the menu on the left-hand side (you might have to refresh the page for it to appear the first time).

You can pin *Movies* and *TV Shows* to the menu to make your life easier.

## Overseerr
If there is nothing in my vast cornucopia of media that is to your taste, fret not - you can request movies and shows and Benflix will automatically obtain™ them for you.

1. Head over to [benflix.watch](https://benflix.watch/) and log in with your Plex account. If you get "Access denied" or a similar error when logging in, wait 30 minutes and try again.
2. Search and request anything your heart desires.

## FAQ
* Benflix will not obtain™ movies until they are released on streaming platforms or in physical formats.
* New movies with an 8+ rating on IMDB are automatically obtained™.
* The [IMDb Top 250 Movies](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) are automatically obtained™.
